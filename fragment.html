    <div>
      <section>

           This Section contains various links to different section of the page.
           <article><a href="#section1" class="">Section1</a></article>
           <article><a href="#section2" class="">Section2</a></article>
           <article><a href="#section3" class="">Section3</a></article>
           <article><a href="#section4" class="">Section4</a></article>

                And here's the page in the browser. And if we click this link, Coursera Facebook Page, it will open a new tab and will load the Facebook page pointed to by that link. Coincidentally, this is a Facebook page I created for the two courses I'm teaching on Coursera which is at facebook.com/CourseraWebDev. So please like this page, and follow it as I'll be posting some optional but interesting and relevant material. Another type of link that is extremely important to know about is a fragment identifier. So here I'm in again in Sublime Text in links-same-page.html. That is located in examples/Lecture09 folder. And as you could see, the links that have set up here all have a very specific format in the href attribute. It's a # followed by some name like section1, section2, and so on. Now what these links are pointing to is a section of our page. Now you could identify a section a couple of different ways. You can have in any tag that has an id with that section name. Notice that the section name does not contain the # sign. Only the link to that section contains the # sign. That's one way to identify a section within the page. Another way is, if we scroll down all the way to the bottom of the page, is to create an anchor tag with a name attribute and name the section very similarly to the way you name a section id. The way you refer to these sections is exactly the same, you put a # in front of the nam
